<h1>Organics Collection In Houses &amp; Small Buildings (1-9 Units)</h1>
<p>Through the <a href="/assets/dsny/zerowaste/residents/nyc-organics-collection.shtml">NYC Organics Collection pilot program</a>, DSNY collects food scraps, food-soiled paper, and yard waste from homes and small buildings in <a href="/assets/dsny/docs/nyc-organics-collection-areas.pdf">pilot areas</a> (PDF).</p>
<p>If your building does not receive Organics Collection, you can still compost your organic waste <a href="/assets/dsny/zerowaste/residents/nyc-compost-project.shtml">at home</a> or at <a href="/assets/dsny/zerowaste/residents/residential-food-waste-drop-off-sites.shtml" title="neighborhood food waste drop-off sites">neighborhood food scrap drop-off sites</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Service Update</strong> — *Note: Glendale, Maspeth, and Middle Village now receive organics collection twice per week on both trash <a href="http://on.nyc.gov/collectionday">collection days</a>.</p>
<h2>Organics Bins</h2>
<p>DSNY provides eligible households in the collection areas a starter kit which includes an indoor kitchen container, instructions, and either their own outdoor brown bin or a larger one to share for the building (if there are between three and nine apartments).</p>
<p>To request a replacement for broken, lost, or stolen outdoor brown organics bins (supplies are limited), submit the <a href="/assets/dsny/contact/services/organics-collection-bin-request.shtml">Bin Replacement Request form</a>. DSNY does not exchange organics bins for different size bins.</p>
<p>DSNY does not replace or redeliver small in-home kitchen collectors. You can purchase your own kitchen collectors or use any container or bag to gather food scraps before emptying them into your outdoor brown organics bin.</p>

<h2>Organics Collection Guidelines</h2>
<p>In pilot areas, follow these guidelines for organics collection:</p>
<p><b>Separate organic waste </b>from your trash and other recyclables. Collect food scraps and food-soiled paper in a kitchen food-scraps container, or in any container or bag. Store the container or bag in a convenient place — such as on the countertop, under the sink, or in the freezer — until your pickup day.</p>
<p>You may line your kitchen container with an acceptable&nbsp;bag or liner for easy clean up. Acceptable bags or liners include newspaper, a brown paper bag, or certified compostable bag that bears the BPI-USCC logo. (See the map below to find local stores that carry compostable bags.)</p>
<p><b>Empty organic waste </b>into your brown bin. Use a clear plastic liner, a brown paper bag, or a certified compostable bag to line your bin. This will help keep your bin clean and reduce odors.</p>
<p><b>Set out the brown bin </b>at the curb for <a href="/assets/dsny/zerowaste/residents/collection-schedule-for-residents.shtml">collection.</a> DSNY-issued brown bins are the only permitted receptacle for food scraps and soiled paper.</p>
<p><b>Set out leaf and yard waste</b> in brown paper lawn and leaf bags, or in an unlined container. They can also be placed inside the brown organics bin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Brooklyn and Queens: no wood debris or firewood. You must <a href="http://www.nycgovparks.org/services/forestry/wood-debris/information">contact Parks Department</a> for disposal due to the Asian Long-Horned Beetle quarantine. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To order free recycling decals</strong> and information on NYC Organics Collection, use the <a href="http://on.nyc.gov/recycling-materials-residents-organics">recycling materials request form</a>.</p>
