<h1>Packaging</h1>

<h2>Purchasing Tips</h2>
<p>When you shop, look for products that have no packaging, or minimal packaging with single layers and single materials. Look for recyclable packaging and packaging with a high recycled content.<br /><br />Buy the largest size products that are practical, if you&rsquo;ll use the product and have storage space. &ldquo;Economy-size&rdquo; items use less packaging than multiples of the small and single-serving sizes.<br /><br />Say &ldquo;no bag, thanks&rdquo; whenever you can. Reuse plastic bags or bring your own reusable bag.<br /><br />New York City water is safe and healthy; use tap water instead of buying bottled water. If you are concerned about the tap water in your home, consider purchasing a water filter instead of bottled water. Some filters can be recycled through manufacturer take-back programs.</p>
