	<p><strong>What To Put in Public Recycling Bins</strong></p>
		<p>
		The City's public recycling bins work the same way as the <a href="/assets/dsny/zerowaste/residents/what-to-recycle-for-residents.shtml">residential recycling program</a>:
	</p>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				In <strong>green bins</strong>, recycle newspapers, magazines, and mixed paper.
			</li>
			<li>
				In <strong>blue bins</strong>, recycle metal, glass bottles and jars, rigid plastic containers, and food and beverage cartons.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p><strong>Recycling at Street Events</strong></p>	
	<p>
		Recycling is required at all NYC street events, including informal block parties and street fairs. Organizers need to contact DSNY at least 3 weeks before a planned event. <a href="/assets/dsny/zerowaste/businesses/street-events.shtml">Learn about recycling and garbage collection at street events</a>.
