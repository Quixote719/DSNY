		<h1>How To Use the Brown Bin</h1>
		
		<p>If your building receives <a href="/assets/dsny/zerowaste/residents/nyc-organics-collection.shtml">curbside organics collection</a>, use these guidelines for setting out your food scraps, food-soiled paper, and yard waste:

		<p><b>Separate organic waste</b> from your trash and other recyclables. Collect food scraps and food-soiled paper in any container or bag. Store the container or bag in a convenient place — such as on the countertop, under the sink, or in the freezer — until your pickup day.

		<p>You may line your kitchen container with an acceptable bag or liner for easy clean up. Acceptable bags or liners include newspaper, a brown paper bag, or <a href="/assets/dsny/zerowaste/residents/compostable-bags.shtml">certified compostable bag</a> that bears the BPI-USCC logo. 

		<p><b>Empty organic waste</b> into your brown bin. Food and yard waste may be set out loose in these bins, or these bins can be lined with ONE of the following: a certified compostable plastic bag that bears the BPI-USCC logo, newspaper, a brown paper bag, or a clear plastic bag.

		<p><b>Set out the brown bin</b> at the curb for <a href="/assets/dsny/zerowaste/residents/collection-schedule-for-residents.shtml">collection</a>. The only permitted receptacle for food scraps and soiled paper is a DSNY-provided or approved organics collection bin, labeled with DSNY&rsquo;s orange &ldquo;food waste&rdquo; decal.

		<p><b>Set out leaf and yard waste</b> in brown <a href="/assets/dsny/zerowaste/residents/fall-leaf-collection.shtml#embedded_map">paper lawn and leaf bags</a>, or in an unlined container. They can also be placed inside the brown organics bin. <i>Do not place leaf and yard waste in plastic bags.</i>
