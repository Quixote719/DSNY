 <p> <strong> Bronx SAFE Disposal Event to be Held Saturday, May 13 </strong> </p>

<p> <strong> Event Provides NYC Residents Easy Option for Disposal of Potentially Harmful Household Items </strong> </p>

 <p>City residents wanting to dispose of potentially harmful household materials may do so at the Department
 of Sanitation’s Bronx SAFE (Solvents, Automotive, Flammables, and Electronics) Disposal event, held Saturday, 
 May 13. The drop-off event will be held at the Orchard Beach parking lot, rain-or-shine, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 
 Residents driving to the free event should follow Park Drive to the end. Last year, the Department collected 
 more than 1,110 tons of material at the SAFE events.</p>

 <p>Household products such as <strong> pesticides, strong cleaners, mercury-containing devices, paints, automotive fluids,</strong> and <strong> medications </strong>
 may be brought to the drop-off events. Residents can also bring electronics, which may no longer be left for curbside collection
 due to a New York state law. </p>
 
 <p>To identify harmful products, look for items marked DANGER, WARNING, POISON, or CAUTION. Please also bring other materials stored
 in your home that you know may be harmful. Only NYC residential waste will be accepted.</p>
 
 <p>“Our SAFE Disposal events give city residents a quick, convenient way to dispose of potentially harmful products, the items many
 of us have under the sink, or in the back of a closet,” said Commissioner Garcia. “We are also thankful to our partners for 
 helping make these events a success year after year." </p>

 <p> DSNY will hold ten SAFE Disposal events in 2017, two per borough. Events were held earlier this season in 
 Brooklyn and Manhattan. Upcoming events include: </p>
