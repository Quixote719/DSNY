<h3>Queens News: Disposal Event to be Held This Saturday for Potentially Harmful Household Materials</h3>
<br />
<h3>“SAFE Disposal Event” Accepts Electronics, Pesticides, Paints, Medications and More </h3>
<p>
New York City residents looking to dispose of potentially harmful household materials may do so at the first Queens SAFE (Solvents, Automotive, Flammables, and Electronics) Disposal event of the year, this <strong> Saturday, June 20</strong>, at Cunningham Park at the Ball Field Parking Lot. Residents driving to the free event should enter on Francis Lewis Boulevard between Union Turnpike and Grand Central Parkway. The drop-off event is held rain or shine, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. </p>
<p>
Household products such as <strong> pesticides, strong cleaners, mercury-containing devices, paints, automotive fluids,</strong> and <strong>medications </strong>will be accepted. Residents may also bring <strong>electronics</strong>, which can no longer be thrown away, because of a New York state law. </p>
<p>To identify harmful products, look for items marked DANGER, WARNING, POISON, or CAUTION. Please also bring other materials stored in your home that you know may be harmful. Only NYC residential waste will be accepted. </p>
<p>
“So many of us have potentially harmful products in the back of a closet, under the sink, or sitting in the garage,” said Commissioner Garcia. “SAFE Disposal events give city residents a quick, convenient way to dispose of these items, and we keep these products out of landfills.”   </p>
<p>
This year, DSNY will hold ten SAFE Disposal events, two per borough. Events occurred earlier this year in Staten Island, Brooklyn and the Bronx. A Manhattan SAFE Disposal event will occur on Sunday, June 28. </p>
<p> <strong> Examples of Accepted Items </strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Automotive products such as motor oil, transmission fluid, and auto batteries </li>
<li>Personal care items like unwanted medicines or cosmetics </li>
<li>Thermometers </li>
<li>Syringes (clearly labeled and packaged in a “sharps” container or other leak proof, puncture-resistant container) </li>
<li>Household products such as pesticides, paint, hazardous cleaners, spent compact fluorescent light bulbs </li>
<li>Electronics, such as computers, televisions, and printers.</li>
</ul>
<p> Materials collected are either recycled, blended for fuel, or sent to licensed hazardous waste treatment facilities for safe disposal.
Electronics are responsibly recycled or refurbished for reuse through <a href="/assets/dsny/zerowaste/residents/e-cyclenyc.shtml"> e-cycleNYC.</a> </p>
<p>
Unwanted medications are managed by environmental police and incinerated to prevent unintentional poisonings or entry into the water supply. DSNY relies on several partners and contractors to make these events a success, including the NYC Department of Parks and Recreation, MCU Park, Surf Ave Parking LLC, Columbia University, Teachers College, Covanta Energy, Electronic Recyclers International, and Veolia ES Technical Solutions. </p>
<p>
