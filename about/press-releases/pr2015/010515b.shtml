<p>Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia announced today that the Department 
    collected 48 tons of trash from the Times Square New Year&rsquo;s cleanup. 
    As the revelers dispersed, a small army of Sanitation Workers began to remove party hats, 
    confetti, and noise makers from the &ldquo;crossroads of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the massive cleanup, Sanitation deployed 178 Sanitation Workers plus 
    supervisory personnel using 26 mechanical sweepers, 25 collection trucks, 38 leaf blowers, 
    and other types of street cleaning equipment to the area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every year, the Department of Sanitation does its part to sweep clean Times 
    Square from the festivities of New York Eve. The cleanup is a tremendous undertaking that&rsquo;s done smoothly, 
    efficiently, and quickly to open the area to pedestrian and vehicular traffic,&rdquo; said Commissioner Garcia. &ldquo;
    Our employees take pride in cleaning up after a big celebration and look forward to doing it again next year.&rdquo;
