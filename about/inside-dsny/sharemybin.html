				<h1>Share My Bin</h1>
<h2>What is this about? </h2>
<p>Some of your neighbors aren&#39;t in the NYC Organics Collection Pilot Program and they&#39;d like to keep their food scraps, food-soiled paper and yard trimmings from being treated like garbage. </p>

<h2>But what do I have to do?</h2>
<p>Almost nothing! Just take the sticker below and add it to your bin. That way, when it&#39;s at the curb, your neighbors will know they can share your bin!</p>

<h2>So, what is  the big deal?</h2>
<p>We are turning your organic waste into soil-enriching compost for our street plants, community gardens and public parks. Soon we&#39;ll use it to create clean, renewable energy to heat homes and businesses across our City! </p>
